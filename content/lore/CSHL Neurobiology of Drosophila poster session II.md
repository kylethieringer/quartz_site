	- **Looming detection invariance in Drosophila descending neurons** 
	- HyoJong Jang
	- DNp01 (giant fiber), DNp03, and DNp06 all respond to looming but how do they respond to contralateral looming?
	- DNp01 and DNp06 respond to looming on both sides and the timing is almost exactly the same no matter which side
		- this suggests that there is contralateral connection in the brain rather than an ascending signal back up to the brain to talk to the other side
	- The speculation is that the fly wants to jump or takeoff as quickly as possible if a predator is coming and then can figure out turning direction once flying

	- **Complementary dynamics of two central complex local neuron populations support goal-directed olfactory navigation**
	- Nicholas Kathman (Nagel Lab)
	- studying complex odor plume navigation
	- hΔCK has a bump of activity that they think corresponds to goal directed straight walking
		- it is only active when the odor turns on, it turns towards the odor then walks straight
	- hΔCK spans across all of the columns of the fan shaped body
	- FC1 is an interneuron that is active only transiently during a turn toward the odor but cannot predict direction of turn from the activity
	- hΔCK has sustained activity probably because of recurrence in the FB
	- both FC1 and hΔCK are necessary for the odor tracking behavior

	- **Investigating the visual motion processing neurons in Drosophila**
	- Sanna Koskela (Michael Reiser Lab)
	- characterizing LPTs - which receive input from T4/T5 cells and their role in optomotor response
	- used flywire to look at the morphology and the NT predictions (but they say the full optic lobe connectome is coming out soon)
	- for all the lines they were able to make splits of, they silenced and then presented different visual stims - grating, spin, looming, etc
	- no clear definitive result silencing single LPTs being necessary for optomotor response 
		- this might be because of redundancy or developmental reasonings (silencing with Kir)

	- **Lighting up the fly brain-High fidelity all optical interrogation of the drosophila neural circuits**
	- Nino Mancini (Salil Bidaye lab)
	- No poster
- 253
	- **Dopamine desensitization demotivates repeated behaviors**
	- Lauren Miner
- 262
	- **Functional labeling of individualized postsynaptic neurons using optogenetics and trans-Tango (FLIPSOT)**
	- Lina Ni
	- express a presynaptic Gal4 UAS-ligand. the ligand then binds to the post synaptic receptor which releases a QF  and expresses a QUAS reporter in the post synaptic cell. 
	- then you also add in a QUAS>stop>Chr or ACR to then stochastically label some of the post synaptic cells through a hsFLP and titrating different temps to get different amounts of FLP activity
	- then you have to stain and image the brain to see which neurons were labeled

	- **Taste and courtship song are integrated to drive social interaction in Drosophila males**
	- Adrian Palacios Munoz (Jan Clemens Lab)
	- males start tapping earlier if they hear song
		- and require more taps to initiate courtship when listening to song
		- other aspects of tapping and courtship initiation also tested
	- song suppresses courtship initiation
	- playing song promotes male-male courtship
	- song may override the taste cues from males 
	- male - female interactions are linearly integrated (song and taste)
- 286
	- **Genetic tools to annotate the electrical and chemical synapses of the Drosophila brain**
	- Thomas Ravenscroft (Gerry Rubin lab)
	- EASI-FISH to find transcription profiles of neuropeptides and innexins
	- building nanotags for neuropeptides
	- everything should be available online
- ==290==
	- **Is love blind? Mating probability gates threat perception**
	- Carolina Rezaval
	- testing escape / defensive behaviors in response to a looming threat
	- LC16 responds to the threat
	- looked for post synaptic targets that would mediate this stopping of courtship and found serotonergic neurons
		- LC16 activates the serotonergic neurons which inhibit P1 and indirectly inhibit pip10
	- they realized that the longer the male has been courting the less likely he is to stop in response to the threat and wanted to know how this was happening
		- found that there is a ramp of activity in TH-C1 neurons during courtship
		- this ramp in activity was just driven by abdomen bending, female not required 
	- I forget the experiment they did to test it but they also found that TH-C1 inhibits LC16
