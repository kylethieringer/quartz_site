the ascending histamine neurons receive a lot of descending neuron input (majority from DNg02) involved with flight behaviors. activity of the ascending histamine neurons predicts flight induction. the downstream targets, as predicted through connectomics, suggests that this flight motor information is then sent to the brain and throughout the vnc.

Cheong et al make multiply unsupported claims... they suggest that AHNs conveys flight motor state however they dont support this claim with any behavioral experiments. they only show that DNg02 activates the AHNs and then use connectomics to make the claim about what information gets passed to different parts of the brain. it feels unsatisfying in thinking about "flight motor state". what are the flight motor states other than on/off that AHNs could be conveying? none of this was explored.
