*note is work in progress*

[[pC1 neurons]] seem to be implicated in a lot of social behaviors in both males and females. 

in males, [[pC1 neurons]] are responsible for driving persistent courtship internal state. P1 activation has been used as a way to drive courtship behaviors including singing, tapping, pursuit, abdominal vibrations, waggling, etc. there has been continued work to start teasing apart the different subpopulations of pC1 neurons, including: 
	- [[P1 neurons]] (and further into P1a) 
		- singing
		- arousal state
		- aggression
		- waggling
	- [[pC1x neurons]] - antagonistic song

in females, [[pC1 neurons]] also drive arousal state
