## fleeting notes

%% begin notes %% 
- onset of flight, there is rapid multisensory integration
- need to engage the wing hinges of both wings in order to have coordinated takeoff. 
- wings that mediate bilateral coordination of wing movements to syncrhonize wing engagements are not known
- wing coordination could be directly modulated via bilateral sensory inputs to motor neurons of steering muscles
- they used calcium imaging and found 3 flight activated central DA interneurons in the VNC which connect and activate motor neurons and steering flight muscles. 
	- activity is context specific. 
	- bilateral wing engagement for flight requires these neurons but they are not needed during courtship
