> [!NOTE] ABSTRACT
>
> Recently, the combination of electronic devices with living insects has been explored to manipulate their crawling or flying, similar to manipulable biological actuators. However, the investigations of controlled flight cessation or flight modulation of the coleopteran characterized by the strong payload capacity have rarely been reported thus far. On the basis of anatomy, this study proposed and validated two separate muscular electrical stimulation protocols to stop and modulate the flight of coleopteran, respectively. The experiment results demonstrated that the suggested cessation protocol realized flight cessation control with a success rate of 83% and a short response time. Meanwhile, the flight modulation stimulation protocol was able to increase the flapping frequency by an average of 7.3%. Finally, we designed a wireless miniature backpack weighing 1 gram to actuate the flight cessation and modulation of coleopteran in free-flying through the remote command transmission. The proposed method has potential applications in the development of the insect-cyborg micro air vehicle.

- coleopteran = beetles
- insect machine interface - IMI - directly manipulates insects movements

- underlying motivation of study is to control where the insect lands by stopping flight

used a cutoff of flight cessation of 2s as successful trial, otherwise a failed trial

inserted electrodes into the DLMs and DVMs and injected a pulse train at 50Hz 50% duty cycle 1 s duration to stop flight - varied the intensity to obtain flight cessation

[[coordinated activity of the flight power muscles are critical for flight]]

when stimulating the DLM and DVMs - they saw wings flapping angle decrease, and the forelegs and middle legs fell underneath the thorax

stimulus injection disrupted the oscillating muscles of the DLMs and DVMs by activating both muscles together rather than how they naturally alternate
- induced a tetanic contraction state

-  **this could be a good possible mechanism for inducing flight cessation in flies -- changing the timing of muscle contraction as opposed to muscle inhibition**
	- one circuit mechanism (that seems maybe less likely) is that there are two complimentary circuits for each muscle group and flight cessation is the activation of the complimentary circuit during the each stage of the wingstroke - so inhibition through muscle activation???

- insects modulate wingbeat frequency by tensioning their thorax (changing stiffness) through the pleurosternal muscle

[[the pleurosternal muscle tensions the thorax]]
- are there any pleurosternal muscle motor neurons in the connectome?
