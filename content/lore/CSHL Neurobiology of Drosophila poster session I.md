	- **Development and transcriptional logic drives sexual dimorphism of the nervous system**
	- Aaron Allen (Stephen Goodwin Lab)
	- created sexed single cell transcriptomic atlas
	- compared the brains and found unsurprisingly that dsx and fru where the biggest differences between sexes
	- combined many datasets from many labs to do a dsx meta analysis
		- clustered the data and there were 6 clusters that came out which corresponded to 
			- aDN, pCd1, pCd2, pC1, pC2m,l
		- looked at which genes were most expressed in each of these clusters and there was one peak for each cluster for a specific protein
		- then they did intersections of dsx and the gene and they got super specific and clean lines labeling all of the neurons in the specific subtype
		- tried the same approach with fru but it was much messier because its more broadly expressed??

	- **A thermometer circuit for hot temperature adjusts Drosophila behavior to persistent heat**
	- Michael Alpert (Marco Gallio Lab)
	- preprint and nature comms paper out in next week or so
	- thermosensory ON responses predict imminent threat
	- TPN III detects the ON response or the change in temperature (hot or cold)
	- downstream of this neuron is a TLHON which primes fly behavior and leads to early turns
		- TLHON tracks the rate of change of temperature
	- used a 2 choice task and looked at the boundary of the cells
		- flies learn over time to turn earlier and earlier away from heat 
		- silencing TLHONs gets rid of this early turning effect

	- **Investigating the control of small error corrections during Drosophila pursuit behavior**
	- Mathew Colli (Rachel Wilson Lab)
	- AOTU 19 recruited through errors to stabilize turning 
		- recruited during pursuit
	- P1 stim enhances activity 
	- inhibition of AOTU19 can cause turning
	- does moment to moment steering corrections

	- **Morphological adaptations to excess activity in single Drosophila Kenyon cells**
	- Tom Cozens
	- hyperactivity reduces claw numbers in Kenyon cells
	- used MARCM to sparsely label KCs (randomly labels and hope to get just one cell alone)
	- expressed TrpA1 in single KCs to make them hyperactive for a period of time
	- only looking at morphological changes and saw a decrease in the dendritic claws

	- **Persistent activation of dopaminergic neurons and its impact on behavior and neural circuitry in Drosophila Larvae**
	- Stephanie Dancausse
	- Nicotine decreases turning in larvae
	- long term recording set up looks very cool but the data collected was all very prelim
	- presenter wasnt at poster so couldnt ask questions
	- didnt see link to dopamine in any of the data

	- **Dissecting social memory circuits in fruit flies**
	- Gulhamay Gardashova
	- Dopamine neurons store social context for days
	- isolated animals track better than group housed animals
	- hypothesized that the neuron that stores the social memory would accumulate activity over long periods of time and store it for long periods of time in its activity
	- developed a new tool to measure this called CRTC::GFP
		- calcium influx activates calmodulin which phosphorylates CRTC. CRTC then enters and stays in the nucleus for a long time
	- could do experiments of social interactions then take the fly and image activity of neurons later
	- found that DAN in the mushroom body stores the social info and it only seems to care about touch, not vision or olfaction

	- **Mating induced somnolence**
	- Ethan Glantz
	- after mating females increase their time sleeping
	- however starved females do not increase their sleep
	- dopamine transporter important for this effect 
	- did a huge screen and there is lots of variability in sleep (12hr range)
