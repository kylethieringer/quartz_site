Here are the plugins I recommend:
- [calendar](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-calendar-plugin) - to keep track of daily notes and easily navigate between them
- [homepage](https://github.com/mirnovov/obsidian-homepage) - to have one note open up always at the start also in conjunction with built in workspaces plugin so I can always load up fresh "environment" for note taking
- [dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) - to query notes and to keep track of todo list items (i use obsidian as my task manager as well as note taking)
- daily notes (built in) - to capture notes everyday and keep todo lists
- templates (built in) - to have some consistency across different note types (see [[take literature notes]] for an example template)
- [zotero integration](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-zotero-integration) - for importing literature notes and figures. See this [**setup guide**](https://medium.com/@alexandraphelan/an-updated-academic-workflow-zotero-obsidian-cffef080addd) but i dont use pandoc that they have here. 

if you have any questions about how I use any of these particular plugins [[kyle thieringer | let me know!]]
