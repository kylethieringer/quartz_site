Entropy can be used to study and classify behaviors. See below:
- [[behavioral entropy is a readout of behavioral repertoire]]
- [[entropy reduction in low dimensional map reveals stereotyped behaviors]]
- [[scale invariance in group behavior modeling]]
- [[maximum entropy model for group dynamics]]

Entropy can also be used to help explain neural processes like plasticity:
- [[freezable chaos is a novel network model of plasticity]]

Entropy can be used to analyze and understand complex neural activity data
