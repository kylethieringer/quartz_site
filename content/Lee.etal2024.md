            Somatosensory neurons provide the nervous system with information about mechanical forces originating inside and outside the body. Here, we use connectomics to reconstruct and analyze neural circuits downstream of the largest somatosensory organ in the
            Drosophila
            leg, the femoral chordotonal organ (FeCO). The FeCO has been proposed to support both proprioceptive sensing of the flyâ€™s femur-tibia joint and exteroceptive sensing of substrate vibrations, but it remains unknown which sensory neurons and central circuits contribute to each of these functions. We found that different subtypes of FeCO sensory neurons feed into distinct proprioceptive and exteroceptive pathways. Position- and movement-encoding FeCO neurons connect to local leg motor control circuits in the ventral nerve cord (VNC), indicating a proprioceptive function. In contrast, signals from the vibration-encoding FeCO neurons are integrated across legs and transmitted to auditory regions in the brain, indicating an exteroceptive function. Overall, our analyses reveal the structure of specialized circuits for processing proprioceptive and exteroceptive signals from the fly leg. They also demonstrate how analyzing patterns of synaptic connectivity can distill organizing principles from complex sensorimotor circuits.
