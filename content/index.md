science accessibility is important to me. I want to experiment with this platform as a means of scientific communication and transparency. 

[[lore/mimir]] is my personal wiki. By publishing these notes, I hope that my [[thoughts transmute to knowledge with lore drops]]. The current scope of this space is not to publish my ongoing research. I cant really predict what might be useful to others, so Im just dumping what has been useful to me (for example [[â¨³ how to]]). Plus, it's so much easier to share a website link to notes rather than exporting from obsidian.

if you have thoughts about anything I've written or not written let [[kyle thieringer|me]] know!
