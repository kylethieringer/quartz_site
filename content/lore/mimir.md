in norse mythology MÃ­mir (pronounced â€œMEE-mir") was the god of knowledge and wisdom. unfortunately, he was beheaded in a war. Odin later found his head. 

Stories suggest that Odin embalmed and carried around MÃ­mir's head to listen to it's secret knowledge and counseling. the Vikings thought of MÃ­mir as the god that retains ancestral tradition.

the name MÃ­mir probably has early etymological roots in words meaning to think, recall and reflect. 

I think mimir is an apt name for this obsidian vault.

my alternative title for the vault was close to be vomitorium and my notes would be voms coming from the latin words vomo meaning "to spew forth" :)
