[[ascending neurons]] integrating large amounts of information from the ventral nerve cord then send projections to the brain (as their name suggests), but also throughout the nerve cord. This is often thought of as integrating and conveying behavioral state to the brain. 

One example of this phenomenon: [[ascending histamine neurons participate in flight feedback loop]]
