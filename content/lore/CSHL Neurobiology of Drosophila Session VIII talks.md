- **The expression of ionotropic receptor in drosophila larvae cool  
cells alters temperature sensitivity in hypertonic environment**
	- Hua Bai
	- studying cool cells in larvae
	- larva prefer to stay at 24C
	- there are cool and warm cells in the DOG (?) that help the larva theromotax
	- A and B type cool cells
		- IR25a and IR93a are the cool receptors
		- IR21a is the tuning center for cooling cells
	- hyptertonic conditions - put larva in sucrose causes stress and loss of B cool cells
		- this is an issue because this is how most people collect larva for experiments
	- overexpression of IR93a strengthens expression of B cells
- **Essential elements of radical pair magnetosensitivity in Drosophila**
	- Adam Bradlaugh
	- radical pair mechanism of magnetism....
	- expressing cryptochrome (CRY) and magnetic field causes cell to fire more
	- if you load the cell with FAD, cell is more potentiated and demonstrated that FAD is helping to make the radical pair in cells
	- with enough FAD, the cell can become sensitive to magnetic fields
	- FAD binds to CRY and this might be the evolutionary mechanism for magneto sensing
	- experiments were done in larva and they would change magnetic fields and larva would change orientation in response.
- **Hunger- and thirst-sensing neurons modulate a neuroendocrine network to coordinate sugar and water ingestion**
	- Amanda J. Gonzalez-Segarra (Kristin Scott lab)
	- regulate thirst and hunger through ISNs in the SEZ
		- thirst = water
		- hunger = sugar
	- 104 post synaptic targets all in the SEZ and SMP
		- pulled out one called the Bilateral T shaped cell
	- ISNs inhibit the bilateral T shaped cell
		- they used ArcLight -- not sure what this tool is
	- sugar and water ingestion is regulated by BiT and CCAP cells
- **Biophysical and molecular bases of activation and adaptation in Johnstonâ€™s organ neurons**
	- Stephen Holtz (Rachel Wilson Lab)
	- 500 JONs that express 2 different TRP channels
	- recording JONs with ephys while manually moving the antenna with a piezo
	- JONs input are the stretching of the cilia in the antenna
	- neighboring JONs have similar inputs but different adaptation rates
	- there is input driven by tension of the cilia and this results in transduction 
		- tension causes spiking in the JONs then the tension has to loosen again
	- but just like a rubber band that stretches and then returns to baseline there is an overshoot in the loosening and then they have to stretch a little more again which causes another little bit of spiking in the JONs
	- nan-inv and nompC required for diversity of responses in JONs and the retension behavior
- **Sensory correlates of electrotaxis in the Drosophila larva**
	- David Tadres
	- asking if larva can electrotax and move to negative side of the chamber
		- basically used a glorified electrophoresis box and they could change the polarity of the box
	- when you flip the polarity of the box, the larva switches direction
	- Gr66a required for the electrotaxis
		- can detect changes in the direction of the electric field
		- depolarizes when facing the anode - like a "stop" neuron
