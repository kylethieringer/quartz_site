[[NSM]] is associated with a large portion of the variance in global brain activity while animals feed and there are neurons throughout the brain that are both positively and negatively correlated with NSM activity. 

Neuron classes with at least one serotonin receptor are more likely to be associated with NSM activity, however the correlations with NSM activity cannot be fully predicted by the serotonin receptor expression. Neuron classes with presynaptic inputs that also express[[ serotonin receptors]] are more likely to be associated with NSM activity.

Therefore, in addition to the brain dynamics that NSM activity directly influences, the larger network of serotonin signaling can influence the NSM-associated brain dynamics.
