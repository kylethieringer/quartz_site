replace beer with your drink of choice (coffee, chai, lemonade, etc). the point is that science is collaborative. The best way that I have found to workshop ideas or give/receive feedback is when physically sharing time and space with someone. 

growing up, food was the epicenter of my family. I have yet to experience a better way to connect with people than by sharing a meal or cooking for others. Food brings people together. It's the reason why food is baked in to cultural identity, religion, and community. 

the act of getting the drink (whatever it may be) serves as a low stakes, but intentional act of care between folks | [[care work is valued work]].
