> [!NOTE] ABSTRACT
>Over the last several years, the use of machine learning (ML) in neuroscience has been rapidly increasing. Here, we review MLâ€™s contributions, both realized and potential, across several areas of systems neuroscience. We describe four primary roles of ML within neuroscience: 1) creating solutions to engineering problems, 2) identifying predictive variables, 3) setting benchmarks for simple models of the brain, and 4) serving itself as a model for the brain. The breadth and ease of its applicability suggests that machine learning should be in the toolbox of most systems neuroscientists.
