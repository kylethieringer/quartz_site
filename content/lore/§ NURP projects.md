## about
NURP stands for neuroscience undergraduate reading program. I meet once per week with an undergrad interested in neuroscience to talk about a paper. I try to structure the quarter that we are working together to have a cohesive and interesting theme. at the end of the quarter, the student presents something about what they have learned to other undergrads and graduate students.
