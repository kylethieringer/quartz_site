The auditory connectome is not set up in a hierarchical way. Analyzing connectivity using [[FlyWire]] reveals positive feedback loops and dense recurrence throughout the neurons that respond to auditory stimuli. There is no evidence that information either converges or diverges at any nodes in the network. This lack of hierarchy has impact on how stimuli are coded due to nonlinear interactions between neurons and causes heterogenous responses to stimuli.
