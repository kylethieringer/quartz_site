I first heard "lore drop" from friends sitting around a table at the College Inn Pub as we shared personal stories and chatted about science with a pitcher or two of beer between us ([[beer is the fuel of collective discovery]])

lore drops is just a fun alternative to 'publishing notes'. 

considering the mythological namesake of this space, lore drops felt fitting as the seeds of [[lore/mimir]]
