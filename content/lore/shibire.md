abbreviated as $Shi^{ts}$ :) it prevents recycling of synaptic vesicles because of a temperature sensitive dynamin mutant. increase the temperature to activate the tool. 


**NOTE**: I think because it prevents recycling theres still a possibility that some NT can initially be released that has been stored up depending on the neurons and conditions. so tread with caution.
