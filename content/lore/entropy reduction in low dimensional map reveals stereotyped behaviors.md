considering that [[behavioral entropy is a readout of behavioral repertoire]], we can use this as an unbiased tool to identify behaviors. if a stimulus (like an opto pulse) drives a specific behavior, you would expect the distribution of behaviors to decrease. hopefully, there is an increase for one specific behavior in the map, though. This indicates a drop in behavioral entropy. Searching for these drops in entropy allows for unbiased identification of stereotypy caused by the stimulus, because the experimenter is not parameterizing the postural data.
