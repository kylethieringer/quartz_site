[[model organisms for studying insect flight]]

- there are even tinier insects like phorid and scatopsid flies. there are tinkerbella wasps for example under 1mm in size. 
- [[Reynolds number]]s - the ratio of inertial to viscous forces on wings
- miniature insects with low Re need to continuously flap wings or they will stop moving
- increasing wingbeat amplitude and frequency increases Re
- most small insects optimize their amplitude rather frequency based on the constraint of the "clap and fling" method of flying - both wings clap at the end of the upstroke
	- but larger insects like drosophila do not do this
- to ease energy expenditure during flight, mini insects have independently evolved ptiloptery-long cilia on wing margins
	- they can act like paddles to help generate more flight forces with less inertial load
- thrips have individual setae that are locked in one of two configurations
	- they can change the configuration by combing before or after flight

[[the thorax mechanically links wings and halteres through oscillations]]
- mechanically linked thoracic framework that coordinates wings and halteres in flies
	- originally identified in soldier flies but probably present in all insects that possess indirect asynchronous flight muscles
	- mechanically linked thorax helps wing coordination at faster rates than what nervous system can control
	- brain just needs to make sure power muscles driving thoracic oscillations are periodically active
	- however this constrains wings from moving independently

[[flying insects decouple wings from thorax for steering]]

- smaller insects with miniaturized neurons results in more intrinsic noise and noisier feedback

- smaller insects have worse vision
	- fewer ommatidia
	- smaller lens diameter means greater diffraction and worse spherical chromatic aberrations and more image blur
- there is very little room for size reduction in molecular machinery for eyes and for olfaction
	- sense of smell in mini insects is limited to close range and limited set of odors
- johnstons organs in mini insects are not well studied

- in diptera, hind wings evolved into mechanosensory halteres which give feedback about angular velocity 
	- during flight, halteres oscillate in phase with wings

- flight muscles are usually separated into direct or indirect flight muscles
	- in some insects a single nerual pulse can result in 10 wing beats because the thoracic shell creates a resonant chamber 
	- delayed stretch activation - property of power muscles where force is generated once they are extended 
- phase relationship between muscles and motor neuron activity is decoupled in asynchronous flight muscles
