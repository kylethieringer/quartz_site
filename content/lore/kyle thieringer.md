Hi! I'm Kyle Thieringer (he/him) and im a graduate student in the neuroscience program co-advised by Sama and John Tuthill. I grew up in the beautiful garden state of New Jersey. I then moved to Boston where I received my bachelors degree in neuroscience from Northeastern University. I've been infatuated with bugs for a long time inside and outside of the lab. My current project is focusing in on the limits of behaviors and specifically what causes them to stop. To get at this question, I'm concentrating on flight cessation. I test my own limits while exploring the pacific northwest through climbing and hiking, or searching for the best bagel in Seattle.
