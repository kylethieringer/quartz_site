the c[[MPOA]] responds minimally to the initial investigation to a new male. after social defeat experience, however, the calcium activity of the cMPOA increases with respect to the level of aggression of the intruder male that the test mouse previously interacted with.

inhibiting cMPOA activity with DREADDs increases aggression towards intruder males and females (maybe reducing social fear?) and activating cMPOA abolishes aggression towards intruders.
