title: coordinated activity of the flight power muscles are critical for flight

the DVMs and DLMs are activated out of phase of each other and their coordination helps create the resonant property of the thorax to drive proper wing beats. Disrupting these precisely timed contraction of power muscles can lead to the cessation of flight.

for example in [[Jiang.etal2022]] they apply a stimulus to the DLM and DVMs in beetles and this results in the cessation of flight because it disrupts the natural coordinated oscillation of the muscles and produces a tetanic contracted state
