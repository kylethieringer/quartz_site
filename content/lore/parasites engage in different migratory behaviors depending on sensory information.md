parasites migrate towards host temperature in a vigorous direct strategy when there is a strong thermal drive (big difference between current temperature and desired temperature?). When thermal drive is low, [[worms engage in local search behavior]]. 

compare parasite locomotion when in isothermal environment (lots of local search):

or when there is a temperature gradient (more direct locomotion):
