- **Elucidating the mechanism of action of an extremely painful venom using Drosophila larvae**
	- Lydia Borjon
	- Biological basis of pain
	- using the venom from the velvet ant (wasp without wings)
	- one of the most painful venoms
	- studying nociception in larvae
	- cIV dendritic arbor neurons are polymodal nociceptors
		- respond to heat, noxious touch, chemical etc
	- imaging calcium in the presence of calcium in larvae
	- interested in ppk1/ppk26 and Balboa genes
	- only one peptide in the venom activated the larval nociceptors (peptide A)
	- there are 5 other peptides identified that are nonspecific and activate mechnosensors in other organisms
	- peptide a is insect specific
