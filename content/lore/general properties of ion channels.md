- currents through single ion channels can be recorded through patch clamp

- the flux of ions through a channel differs from diffusion in a free solution
	- driving force is determined by electrical potential difference and concentration gradients
	- some open channels act as simple resistors where current varies linearly with driving force
	- some channels behave as rectifier - conducts ions more readily in one direction than in the other, where current is nonlinear function of driving force

- the opening and closing of a channel involve conformational changes
	- each ion channel has at least one open and one closed state

- the structure of ion channels is inferred from studies

- ion channels can be grouped into gene families
