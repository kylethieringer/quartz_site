- how do flies distinguish self motion from looming visual stimuli to activate different behaviors
- two descending neurons that control landing and behavioral flexibility
	- silencing impairs landing
	- activation drives landing
	- spike rate determines leg extension amplitude
- DN activity attenuated during non flight periods
	- decouples visual stimuli from landing when not appropriate
- octopamine exposure mimics flight effects in DN
- sensory and motor netowrks are coupled or decoupled according to behavioral state

- looming circuits have been well studied
	- 2 projection neurons from optic lobes are looming feature detectors and synapse onto giant fiber descending neuron which activates motor neurons in VNC to initiate takeoff 
	- [[Wu.etal2016]] mapped the [[LCs convey specific visual features to the brain]]
	- [[Klapoetke.etal2017]] figured out [[the giant fiber receives visual input from LPLC2 driving looming escape behavior]]  

- the same looming stimulus can trigger escape and landing responses which are opposite motor behaviors depending on if the fly is flying or not
- optogenetically activated 133 DN split gal4 lines to find landing control neurons\
- only DNp07 and DNp10 elicited landing extensions of all six legs

- silencing DNp07 or DNp10 reduced landing in response to looming stim


- presented visual stimuli and saw spiking in DNp07 and DNp10 which preceded leg movements
	- also found that spike rate correlated with leg extension amplitude
	- tuned opto stim to match visual stim and more intense stim resulted in large leg amplitudes

- visual responses in DNp10 were eliminated without flight
- visual responses in DNp07 were reduced below spike rate required for leg movement activation

- gating of landing happens at the level of DN dendrites
	- opto activation of DNs in non flying flies produce landing like extensions

- [[octopamine]] is released during flight
	- bath application and release by activation of neurons mimic flight state and increase responses of visual interneurons
- gating of responses in DNp07 is mediated by octopamine but DNp10 is not 
- DNp10 gets tonically depolarized during flight and repolarized at flight cessation
	- this indicates that DNp10 gets direct feedback from flight circuitry either from mechanosensory feedback or input from motor
