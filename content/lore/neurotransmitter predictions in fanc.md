in [[fanc]], there is currently no neurotransmitter predictions for synapses like what exists in [[FlyWire]]. currently, the best way predict the neurotransmitter is through classifying the neuron into a hemilineage and then using the hemilineage as a proxy for what the likely NT is. 

current cave tables that have pretty decent NT info:

```
neurotransmitter_hemilineage_table
left_t1_local_premotor_table_v6  
downstream_23b_table_v0  
downstream_bristle_table_v2
```
these have good hemilineage labels which can then be classified as inhibitory or excitatory
