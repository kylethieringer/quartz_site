activation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) gated cation channels is required for thermosensation in all nematodes. the channels are composed of subunits of the tax-2 and tax-4 genes. these genes are the genetic markers of AFD neurons ([[AFD neurons are required for positive thermotaxis]])

It is still unclear to me the biophysics of how this receptor confers temperature sensitivity. Are these analogous to TRP channels? Do they have the same action?
- Takeishi et al 2016 suggests yes to these questions in c elegans... still unclear what the mechanism is to me though in the initial temperature sensing step. See diagram below for proposed pathway (from [[Bryant.etal2022]]):

rGCs are the thermosensors themselves in s stercoralis as well ([[Bryant.etal2022]] Fig 6).

rGCs are also used for chemotaxis behaviors in c elegans (and most likely strongyloides as well just hasnt been tested)
