miniSOG - mini Singlet Oxygen Generator

miniSOG generates reactive oxygen species after illumination with blue light. PH-miniSOG is the next iteration of the miniSOG tool lineage which expresses the protein in the membrane rather than other version that express it somewhere in the cell. PH- miniSOG is much faster at ablating cells and very effective at killing neurons. PH miniSOG kills cells regardless of what kind of cell, and does not spread to neighboring cells.
