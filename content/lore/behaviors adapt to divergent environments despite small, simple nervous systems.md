one possibility for this adaptation is that individual neurons alter functional properties through receptor changes, neurotransmitter expression, or neuromodulator expression
- different species can express different neuropeptides in the same neuron for example

another option is that there is distinct synaptic connectivity between species which drives the unique behaviors in response to the various environments
