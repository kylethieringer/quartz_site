the same visual looming stimulus can trigger both escape and landing responses, opposite motor behaviors, depending on if the fly is flying or not.

escape behavior has been well studied in non-flying flies | [[looming feature detectors convey visual information to VNC for takeoff response]]. 

these responses are mediated by DNp07 and DNp10 | [[DNp07 elicits visually evoked landing motor patterns during flight]] and [[DNp10 elicits visually evoked landing motor patterns during flight]]
