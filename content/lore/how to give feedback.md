giving feedback is a skill that takes time and effort. Its important to be specific and timely with feedback, but to also make space for it. receiving and giving feedback helps build trust, relationships and community. One framework for providing feedback is to structure it as presenting the situation, explaining the behavior, and describing the impact of that behavior. This model helps tailor the feedback to be specific and actionable. 

and a reminder that feedback can be positive and negative. providing positive feedback frequently is just a good thing to do :)
