machine learning algorithms use large amounts of input data and can then predict the relationship between two variables. neuroscientists use machine learning to understand behavior, disease, neural activity, etc. we can [[use machine learning to track animal poses]] to better quantify and study behavior. we can use machine learning to diagnose disease based on neuroanatomy. 

however, there are [[limitations to machine learning]]
