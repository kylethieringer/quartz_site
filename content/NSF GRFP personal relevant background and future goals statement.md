## intellectual merit

- have shown dedication and commitment to using the fly as a model organism through projects in undergrad about fly courtship and copulation.
	- these projects led to better understanding the underlying principles of decision making, learning, and motivation in neural circuits. 
- as a technician i was involved with many projects, one was an independent project, one led to coauthorship on a paper
	- i presented my independent project results at a drosophila conference
	- my project involved collaborating with multiple labs (one in germany, one in switzerland) 

## broader impacts
- have mentored 3 undergrads so far in the neuro undergrad reading program
	- created a research project with them
	- assigned relevant papers pertaining to that project
	- discussed those papers
	- helped create a presentation communicating what they learned over the quarter
- committee member of the housing justice workgroup in our student union
	- working to increase accessibility to affordable housing in seattle through the mfte program
- co organized student seminar series called popcorn talks

## future goals
- teaching is important to me so I would like to continue doing that in conjunction with research
- would like to have a lab
