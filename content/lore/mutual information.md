"==Mutual information is a non-linear measure of the degree of dependence between two variables and is typically measured in units of bits (Cover and Thomas, 2005). The higher the mutual information, the more the first variable, here the behavior of flies immediately prior to red light activation as measured by their distribution in the behavior space at t = 1.5 to 0.5 s, informs the value of the second variable, the region of the behavior space occupied in the first second of red light activation.==‚Äù[Page 10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JH3TT2XJ?page=10&annotation=WDEJ6K5V) [[Cande.etal2018]]
