zebrafish typically swim in bouts as opposed to smooth continuous motion. volumetric calcium imaging in the dorsal thalamus revealed peak response to virtual stimuli with variable speeds compared to continuous speeds. they also have increased response when the acceleration increases during these bouts. the highest response in the dorsal thalamic neurons are to naturalistic swim bout speeds. these neurons reveal socially relevant feature detection important for how shoaling behaviors emerge. | [[social behaviors in fish depend on specifically tuned visual circuits]]

- top - variable speeds in bouts
- middle - variable speeds in continuous motion
- bottom - bouts of variable acceleration


importantly they also show that these neurons are separate from the visually evoked stimuli during self motion (like [[optic flow]] kinda stuff?). what are these (im assuming) parallel pathways?
