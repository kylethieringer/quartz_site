first proposed by sombati and hoyle in locusts about how behavioral states are controlled. it says that specific sets of octopaminergic neurons were involved in generating specific behaviors. However, [[Suver.etal2012]] test the hypothesis using the visual system during flight. They show that flies can still fly without octopamine which goes against the strict interpretation of the hypothesis. Regardless, octopamine is still crucial for state dependent activity during different behaviors which I think is still in line with a broader interpretation of the hypothesis
