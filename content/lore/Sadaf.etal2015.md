## fleeting notes

%% begin notes %% 
- onset of flight, there is rapid multisensory integration
- need to engage the wing hinges of both wings in order to have coordinated takeoff. 
- wings that mediate bilateral coordination of wing movements to syncrhonize wing engagements are not known
- wing coordination could be directly modulated via bilateral sensory inputs to motor neurons of steering muscles
- they used calcium imaging and found 3 flight activated central DA interneurons in the VNC which connect and activate motor neurons and steering flight muscles. 
	- activity is context specific. 
	- bilateral wing engagement for flight requires these neurons but they are not needed during courtship

[[neuromodulation of flight]]

- serotonin, octopamine and dopamine all implicated in the neuromodulation of flight

- flight bouts from 30 to 300 seconds
- flight evoked response in 3 DA neurons

[[three dopamine neurons in the VNC coordinate wings during flight]]
- found only 3 neurons labeled by TH>CaLexA when staining for GFP 8 hr after flight
	- this seems wildly specific to me, no other TH neurons were labeled??
	- how does CaLexA work?
	- no brain neurons labeled -- is flight intrinsically rewarding for flies - how would that get to brain because they fly for hours in close loop?

- Shibire - prevents recycling of synaptic vesicles because of a temperature sensitive dynamic mutant
- Kir2.1 - inward rectifying potassium channel

- flight tested with the cylinder drop assay

- DLMs receive input from motor nuerons at 10Hz

- TH-aa' required for flight

- [[wings have synchrony during both initiation and cessation of flight]]
	- they report that wings stay extended for 30s at cessation before fully folding in (im assuming for spontaneous flight)

- the dopamine neurons synapse onto b1 direct flight muscle motor neurons


- for flight cessation mechanisms does toe touching stop courtship?
- sexually dimorphic neurons that connect to the wing?
