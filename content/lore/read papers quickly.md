when I am reading papers quickly and shallowly, I am not worrying about taking notes. I want to try to get the essence of a paper and nothing more. I can then decide to revisit it ([[read papers closely]]) or put it in my archive if it ends up being not as relevant for me. 

one exercise I really enjoyed to practice this was to set 60 minutes aside to read 5 papers. I spend 10 minutes on each paper with a couple minutes in between to reset and give my brain a break. It is surprising how much you can get from a paper in 10 minutes.
