consider a flock of birds (as in [[Bialek.etal2012]]):

if you take a snapshot of a flock of birds, there is a distribution of velocities of the individual birds and we can compare the normalized velocities to neighboring birds. you can do this for individual neighbors or multiple neighbors. the number of birds in the flock does not change model accuracy -- cool!
