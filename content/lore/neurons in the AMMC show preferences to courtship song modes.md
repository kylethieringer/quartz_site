using split gal4 lines to label sparse neurons in the AMMC, some neurons respond to pulse song, some neurons respond to sine song and some neurons respond to both. there was a roughly even distribution among these three groups in the neurons they tested. Within each song mode preference neurons, there was still a dynamic range of timescales and amplitudes in response to the stimuli. 

This [[diversity of responses to song stimuli may facilitate integration of multiple timescales during courtship song]]
