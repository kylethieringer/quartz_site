short term synaptic facilitation models predefine the connections and networks of neurons and that they sustain activity for a specific period of time. the freezable chaos framework allows for any network state to be stored making it more flexible. additionally, traditional models have limits on the stored activity because it decays overtime unless reactivated. freezable chaos has none.
