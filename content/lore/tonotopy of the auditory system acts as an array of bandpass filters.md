when presenting a range of stimuli to the antenna of the fly, [[Patella.Wilson2018]] recorded [[Johnston's organ neurons|JON]] response types and performed unsupervised clustering of single pixel values of their calcium imaging datasets. Groups of correlated pixels were clustered and revealed a map of responses spatially, where low frequencies activated medial neurons spanning to high frequency responses laterally. Each response type has a range of amplitudes they were responsive too and there are various adaptation profiles for each type. The center frequencies of each type range from 0-600hz (each acting as a somewhat bandpass filter)

notably, [[courtship song]] recruits all JON types.

similar [[tonotopy]] was found in the [[antennal mechanosensory and motor center|AMMC]] and [[wedge|WED]]. However, the AMMC showed over representation of low frequencies and the wedge over represented extreme frequencies. The wedge also had much narrower tuning of each individual response. This also led to a more orderly tonotopic representation in the wedge.
