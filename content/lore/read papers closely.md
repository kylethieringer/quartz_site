I only take notes on papers when I read papers closely and deeply. I usually have the paper open in zotero and obsidian opened and I jot down notes as I read. I read papers for different reasons, sometimes for methods, sometimes for interesting results. I try to take notes on anything I spend time thinking about or want to remember, as "fleeting notes". As I make notes, modular or not, Im trying to always think about connections to other notes or papers. This helps build ideas. Sometimes its obvious what the connections are -- related papers, methods, etc. Sometimes its a random thought that reminds me of a completely different paper and I may make new notes to help flesh out these connections. Use the notes in whatever way is most helpful to you. 

[[take modular notes | modular notes]] often emerge from these fleeting notes organically. 

ive also been practicing reading papers using different lenses -- see [[dumit styles of reading]]
