applying to grad school is an incredibly exciting but extremely daunting endeavor. unfortunately, the process is not transparent. 

if you would like access to my application materials, contact [[kyle thieringer|me]]! ill share my entire application package despite my cringe when I reread it.

there are multiple stages to the process:
- [[how to find schools to apply to]] | I applied to 17 programs
- [[how to create application package]]
- [[considerations for grad school interviews]] | I interviewed at 7 programs
- [[how to choose the right graduate program]] | i was accepted to 6 programs

I do not recommend my approach, both for financial reasons (applications are expensive) and energy capacity reasons (application process is exhausting).

I am now a happy phd student in the neuroscience program at the university of washington :)
