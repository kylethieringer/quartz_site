c elegans monotonically and non linearly enocde temperature as seen by their AFD calcium responses to temperature gradients. strongyloides have an initial warming triggered inhibition then linear encoding of temperature changes. the initial reduction is hypothesized to reset the dynamic range of AFD neurons. 

This vastly different temperature encoding highlights a huge evolutionary transition and adaptation underlying one aspect of the very different thermal behaviors of these 2 relatively closely related nematodes.
