the most important thing to do is start early! Id recommend starting this process in the summer before applications are due.

create a long list of schools you are interested in, even if only slightly interested in and you can narrow it down later. 

my initial list of schools contained maybe 30-50 programs and mostly involved perusing the program websites, looking at potential faculty I might want to work with, and considering location. 

the program itself may be important to you but often faculty are jointly involved with many departments. for example, the neuroscience program at one school may be more competitive than the biology program but share the same faculty. at the end of the day, all that will really change is some of the courses and the degree on your cv. I applied to some biology programs, mostly neuroscience programs, and a psychology program. 

when considering schools, this is a great time to send the list to friends and colleagues for advice. grad students, postdocs, and faculty you interact with often have a wealth of insider knowledge about schools and programs and can quickly inform you about red flags or wrong fits in your list.

when solidifying your final list I have the same recommendation that most have: make sure there are at least 3 faculty you would want to work with. most programs start with lab rotations and to figure out the best fit for you to do your thesis work in. sometimes the lab you are most interested in, doesnt have space or the mentor is the wrong fit for you so its always good to have some choices!

this early stage is a great time to start building your support network during the application process -- finding people who might be wiling to read your application materials or give feedback for the next stages of the process.
