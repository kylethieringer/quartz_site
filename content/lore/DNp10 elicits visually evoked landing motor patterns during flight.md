during flight, a looming stimulus will drive landing behavior. this is mediated by two descending neurons ([[DNp07]] and [[DNp10]]). DNp10 only responds to looming stimulus during flight.

in response to looming stimulus. [[DNp10]] is tonically depolarized during flight and repolarizes at flight cessation.

Unlike DNp07, DNp10 is not gated by octopamine, but instead is most likely gated by direct feedback from the motor patterns in the VNC. This is hypothesized because of the tonic depolarization compared to DNp07's activity.
