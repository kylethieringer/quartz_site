hub notes organize everything related to your project in one central place. they take advantage of obsidian's backlinking feature to quickly bring all project information together. Everything from links to google sheets containing experimental notes, to google docs with protocols, etc. can go here. You can keep track of any project related action items here in this note. Links to relevant literature can also live here.

Another key aspect of the hub note is to organize your daily notes in a "timeline". Its a good way to quickly reference what was completed on each day, and how frequently you are working on a project. the timeline contains backlinks to your daily notes with a short summary to reference what project related tasks were completed on that day ([day notes are critical for an effective lab notebook](https://publish.obsidian.md/ahmedlab/atoms/day+notes+are+critical+for+an+effective+lab+notebook),¬†[how to keep a digital lab notebook](https://publish.obsidian.md/ahmedlab/atoms/how+to+keep+a+digital+lab+notebook)). (these links are password protected...sorry) the daily notes are like the classic lab notebook entry. every detail of everything that happened, either for experiments or class. they can have links to other notes, protocols, or whatever!

the hub note is meant to be a tool, so add anything that helps you with your project!

hub notes can have the outline of something like this (a suggestion not a rule)
```
## intro to the project

## todo list

## completed list

## external links to google sheets, protocols, etc

## relevant literature

## timeline for daily notes
	[[2023-11-09]] - a short summary of what was accomplished 
	[[2023-11-08]] - wrote notes for "how to keep a lab notebook" 
	[[2023-11-07]] - some other project related thing

```
