- Brain wiring determinants uncovered by integrating connectomes and transcriptomes
	- Yerbol Kumangalliyev
	- how are connectomes encoded in genomes?
	- we have access to all molecules present in all cells
	- using the motion detection circuit T4/T5 neurons
	- complete connectome available from Janelia
	- transcriptomes of all T4 subtypes and LPC cells reveals they are developmentally sister cells
	- most T4/T5 express similar adhesion molecules
	- there are 2 parallel synaptic pathways revealed from ligand receptor pairs in these neurons
		- they select the best match not the perfect match restricting synaptic target sites to specific layers but it may not be perfect ligand receptor matches

- The first complete connectome of an adult insect nerve cord (MANC)
	- Elizabeth Marin (Greg Jefferis lab)
	- the problem of how to define cell types
	- they typed 23,000 in the nerve cord
	- you can use morphology, neurotransmitters, or developmental lineage

- Seymore Benzer Lecture
	- Marc Freeman
	- the nervous system is pruned over time - called remodeling
	- some cells also die and are eliminated from circuits
	- what role do glia play in local pruning?
		- do they actively select neurons or just recycle the dead neurons
	- glia act as agents when we think about them in this way...
	- using metamorphosis as the system because there is a huge amount of remodeling occurring from larva to pupa to fly and specifically looking at Crz neurons
		- lots of crz neurons present in in larva but none in pupa
	- Turtle protein drives caspase activation
		- knockdown in Crz neurons and there is no cleaving of caspase and this activates degeneration -- many of the neurons die but always the same 2 remain in one of the segments
	- tweek is a highly conserved gene
		- involved in phagocytosis and activates engulfment gene
		- the protein is a huge tubular structure with a hydrophobic pore
		- Bridge like Transfer protein (BLTP)
			- pour lipids from ER to cytoplasm
