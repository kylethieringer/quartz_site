[[lipid bilayers are impermeable to ions]] so ions must pass through ion channels. smaller ions attract water more strongly because its charge is more highly localized. this effectively makes a larger water shell and means that smaller ions, like Na+, will behave like larger molecules compared to larger ions, like K+. 

size of the molecule still doesnt tell the full story. see [[pore theory explains channel selectivity]]
