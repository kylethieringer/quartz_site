nernst equation can be used to find the equilibrium potential of any ion 
$$E_{x} = \frac{RT}{zF}ln\frac{[X]_{o}}{[X]_{i}}$$

R = gas constant
T = temperature (K)
z = valence of ion
F = Faraday constant
$[X]_{o}$ = concentration outside of cell
$[X]_{i}$ = concentration inside of cell

RT/F is 25mV at 25C
