male specific splicing of the [[fruitless]] gene is required for male [[courtship]] behaviors. expressing the female isoform of fruitless (FruF) in males abolishes courtship. expressing the male isoform (FruM) in females drives courtship towards other wildtype females, but suppresses female receptivity and egg laying.
