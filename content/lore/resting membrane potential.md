membrane potential is created by charge separation between the inside and outside of the cell. there is more positive charge outside of the cell than inside of the side and ions cannot diffuse through the lipid bilayer

$$V_{m} = V_{in} - V_{out}$$

resting potential is when there is no net flow of ions in or out of the cell
