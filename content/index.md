science accessibility is important to me. I want to experiment with this platform as a means of scientific communication and transparency. 

[[lore/mimir]] is my personal wiki. By publishing these notes, I'm trying to lean into the idea that [[thoughts only transmute to knowledge with lore drops]] because academia is largely opaque. The current scope of this space is not to publish my ongoing research (although the papers/notes here may give pretty good insight to what that involves). I cant really predict what might be useful to others, so Im just dumping what has been useful to me (for example [[⨳ how to]]). Plus, it's so much easier to share a website link to notes rather than exporting from obsidian. The selfish motivation behind publishing mimir is to keep myself accountable in my own scholarship and for personal growth through this act of writing.

if you have thoughts about anything I've written or not written let [[kyle thieringer|me]] know! while there is not currently a way to have an open discussion on this site like what a blog format provides, I am more than happy to publish comments (anonymously if so desired). I would also be more than happy to incorporate any contributions or edits you may have!
