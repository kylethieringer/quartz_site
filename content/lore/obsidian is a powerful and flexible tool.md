[obsidian](https://obsidian.md) is a wrapper for **markdown files** (basically just text files). this is really nice for a number of reasons:
1. private local storage of your notes
2. you own your notes, not some other company
3. freedom to move notes anywhere anytime to other markdown wrappers (like [logseq](https://logseq.com/) for example) or just open markdown files in any text editor.
