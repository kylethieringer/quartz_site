[research rabbit](https://researchrabbitapp.com/home) is a fantastic way to find related papers. you can input one or multiple papers, then it will suggest related, earlier, or later papers. earlier papers may reveal "seminal works" in the field. if there are tons of related papers that pop up in the intersection of the papers you input, you are probably browsing a popular field. and alternatively, if not many related papers pop up, you may have stumbled on a gap in the field!

you can also hook it up to your reference manager (like zotero) to easily add or save papers.

I think the motivation that drives research rabbit is that the algorithm they use offers a more unbiased approach that alternative methods that rely purely on citation networks (because citation practices are highly biased).
