- identify the theromsensory neurons in Strongyloides stercoralis
	- functional adaptations that enable precise encoding of temp
	- flexible behavior of infective larvae to track body temperature or reverse heat attraction at below body temp

- stercoralis infect at least 600 million people
	- fatal for immunosuppressed people
- infect exclusively at iL3 stage

- [[AFD neurons are required for positive thermotaxis]]

- [[nematode thermosensory neurons detect temperature changes through guanylate cyclase receptors]]

- [[AFD neurons response to heat demonstrates evolutionary adaptation]]
