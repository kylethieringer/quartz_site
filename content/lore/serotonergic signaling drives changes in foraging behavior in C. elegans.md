*C. elegans* express 6 different [[serotonin receptors]] and have only a few serotonergic neurons ([[NSM]], HSN, and ADF). 

NSM activity controls slowing in response to food but all 6 receptors are important for the full repertoire of behavioral responses to food. 

Activation of NSM drives slowing, pharyngeal pumping and decreased head movements, which align with naturalistic [[foraging]] behaviors

Knocking out individual or combinations of the receptors reveals that there are 3 "driver" receptors (mod-1, ser4, and lgc-50) that have the strongest impact on foraging behavior, whereas the other 3 receptors only modulate the behavioral response.
