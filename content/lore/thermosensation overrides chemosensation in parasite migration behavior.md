exposure to attractive odor results in local search behavior toward odor source. however in thermal gradient, migration behavior is unaffected by odor presence. especially at temperatures below host temp, temperature driven behaviors are prioritized.

- 3m1b is an attractive odor. these track are migration of S.sterocoralis. dots are the location of the odor source. gray bars indicate starting location of worms


this could either be because temperature is a better predictor for a host, or this specific "attractive odor" wasnt the strongest... because some worms in panel A dont even go towards the odor?
