the act of writing is a tool for thinking. meaningful notes are the foundation of this vault and are written to develop and grow ([[metamorphosis of a note]]). the strategies for developing this style of writing come from the lessons I learned from sama and the archetypal "[Evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes)" written by andy matuschak. 

I try to [[take modular notes]] whenever possible. when reading scientific papers I usually start writing in my literature notes ([[take literature notes]]), which then may lead to modular notes - [[how I read academic papers]]. I recommend ([[Ahrens2017]]) for some philosophy behind writing (it is also referenced heavily in the evergreen notes) in order to better connect ideas as they emerge.

I [[use hub notes to organize projects]]. these projects could be related to research or organizing class notes. it is more of a framework to start connecting ideas in a place that is easy to navigate.
