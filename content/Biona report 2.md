## notes
---

- the reflex for stimulating flight by blowing air on the head of an insect was first described in 1949 by Weis-Fogh, using a locust (Fig 2.2-1, pg 3)

- "the endogeneous rhythm generated by the central nervous flight oscillator is controlled by proprio and exteroreceptive feedback" (pg11)

- large indirect muscles (dvm 1, 2, 3 and dlm)
	- produce power
- small direct steering muscles 

- flight muscles are asynchronous to neuron firing - one action potential for every couple of wing beats

- the most famous proprioceptive organ in the locust is the wing hinge stretch receptor - responds to raising and lowering of the wing (pg 81)
- there is another proprioceptor - the forewing tegula
