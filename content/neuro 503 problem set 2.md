1.  Read the Solis & Doupe paper. Come to discussion ready to discuss it in detail.

2. Consider how a neuron could become song selective (i.e. responsive to a forward song, say syllables ABCDE, but not in reverse order:  EDCBA).  For simplicity, break the problem into two stages:  what cellular circuitry could give rise to a neuron selective for AB over BA?  Then generalize to 5 syllables. Please limit this to one page.

3. Download one of these pieces of software, or any other that can make spectrograms. Audacity (Windows/Mac/Linux); Praat; Spek; SpectroPro for iPhone; or many others). Download the Wav files from the Canvas Module for my section and make spectrograms. Record yourself speaking or whistling and make spectrograms. Use a phone or laptop to record a bird song outside and make spectrograms. No need to turn these in, but I’d love to hear your impressions of this activity.

4. No more than 1 page, PDF. A. Given your experience with spectrograms above, how can we compare the similarity of 2 songs? B. What algorithms would you use to determine how similar two renditions of a single bird’s song are? C. How would you quantify trial-to-trial variability?
