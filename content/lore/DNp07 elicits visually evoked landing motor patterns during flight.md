during flight, a looming stimulus will drive landing behavior. this is mediated by two descending neurons ([[DNp07]] and [[DNp10]]). DNp07 only responds to looming stimulus during flight.

here are whole cell recordings during presentation of looming stimulus. pink is during flight, black is during non-flight. the right plot is superimposed.

**However**, these behavioral state dependent responses depend on [[octopamine]] | [[octopamine gates activity of DNp07]]
