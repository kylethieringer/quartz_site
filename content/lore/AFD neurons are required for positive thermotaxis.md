 Silencing AFD neurons in strongyloides reduces positive thermotaxis behaviors and increases search behaviors (circling). speed is reduced and distance traveled is also reduced when silencing AFD neurons.

- silencing with histamine gated chloride channel (HisCl) expressed in AFD neurons. Adding histamine conditionally silences the neurons but may have other effects since you have to bathe the worms in a histamine solution which doesnt sound super fun.
