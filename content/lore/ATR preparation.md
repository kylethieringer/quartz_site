flies need [[ATR]] supplemented in their diet in order for optogenetic tools to function properly.

for most updated protocol, refer to [this google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VyuAkLmM_4JCjinqEqDCwfptKW6fOcByz_w2kJcptpU/edit?usp=sharing)

here is a quick reference for making 10mM stock solution from 100mg of powder using 95% ethanol:

> [!example] equation to calculate volume of 95% ethanol needed to make solution
> $100 mg * \frac{1g}{1000mg} * \frac{1 L}{10 mmol}* \frac{1000 mmol}{1 mol} * \frac{1 mol} {284.44 g} * \frac{1000 mL}{1L} = 35.2mL$
