organizing notes i take just to keep track of things for now
## background
- [[model organisms for studying insect flight]]
- [[hemilineages provide a functional and anatomical classification for neurons in the vnc]]
## muscles involved with flight
- [[anatomy of wing muscles]]
- [[the pleurosternal muscle tensions the thorax]]
## flight mechanics
- [[the thorax mechanically links wings and halteres through oscillations]]
- [[flying insects decouple wings from thorax for steering]]
- [[wings have synchrony during both initiation and cessation of flight]]
## descending control
- [[three dopamine neurons in the VNC coordinate wings during flight]]
- [[looming stimulus evokes opposite behaviors depending on behavioral state]]
- [[looming feature detectors convey visual information to VNC for takeoff response]]
## neuromodulation
- [[neuromodulation of flight]]
- [[ascending histamine neurons participate in flight feedback loop]]
- [[octopamine activity increases during flight]]
- [[coordinated activity of the flight power muscles are critical for flight]]
## examples of flight cessation
- [[bio robotic research coarsely demonstrate flight cessation with implanted neural stimulations in large insects]]
