looming circuits have been well studied for many years. the visual information about the looming stimulus is detected by different groups of LCs, including [[LPLC2]] and LC4. | [[LCs convey specific visual features to the brain]]. These LCs directly synapse onto the giant fiber descending neuron | [[the giant fiber receives looming visual input from LPLC2]]. 

the [[giant fiber]] then connects to circuits in the VNC to initiate takeoff. 

But depending on behavioral state, looming may initiate landing or takeoff -- see [[Ache.etal2019]]
