worms move in relation to a cultivation temperature. if the ambient temperature changes, the remembered temperature can reset within a couple of hours. 

these data describe thermotaxis behaviors for S. stercoralis but similar behavior is seen in C. elegans as well.

$T_{c}$ = cultured temperature (temperature the worms were raised)
$T_{start}$ = temperature the worms were placed at the start of the experiment
