"Care is a form of political and ethical practice", and disproportionately affects different groups based on their identity. Care work is time dedicated for purposes beyond one's own immediate or personal gain. It could include training others,  maintaining equipment, cleaning, note taking, scheduling, caring for others mental and physical health, making lab a fun place to be, and thanking each other.

care work is often overlooked as a meaningful contribution, but is vital for making science more equitable and fun. | [[equity in authorship order requires diverging from conventional metric systems]]
