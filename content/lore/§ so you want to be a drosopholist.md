there are many great online resources for new drosopholists ([drosophila workers unite](https://marksteinlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/MicheleMarkstein-DrosophilaWorkersUnite-PREPRINT-JAN2019.pdf), [bloomington resources](https://bdsc.indiana.edu/stocks/misc/edu_links.html), [flying thru science](https://sci-flies.com/), https://www.kaunlab.com/behavior-blog). I have informally taught the following topics to new labmates and fellow students and have found that many resources explain some things well but not everything well. Here, ill compile what I think is useful, and point to where to go for more. its a slow work in progress, adding as I have time.
## genetics
- general drosophila genetics
- binary expression systems
- gene markers
- balancer chromosomes
- recombination
## fly pushing
- fly life cycle
- maintaining stocks
- making crosses
- collecting virgins
## tools
- [[genetic toolbox in flies]]
- quick introduction to optogenetics
- quick introduction to RNAi
## behavior
- best practices for behavior experiments
- best practices for imaging experiments
