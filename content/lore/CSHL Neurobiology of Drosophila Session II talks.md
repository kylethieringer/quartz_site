- Promiscuous wiring of the mushroom body via variable spatial sampling of an orderly array
	- Emma Thornton-Kolbe (Josie Clowney lab)
	- Kenyon cells receive multiple sensory inputs and act as incidence detectors from each of the olfactory projections
	- all of the connections are set up during development
	- how are projection neurons organized in the calyx of the mushroom body?
	- dendrites of the "claws" morphology organized by developmental origin
	- KCs prioritize partnership rather than partners
		- dont care about identity of the projection neurons just the number of synapses
