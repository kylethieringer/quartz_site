%% begin notes %% 
- animals move in order to drive self induced sensory activation. 
- animals differentiate between internal and external sensory info through corollary discharge circuits 
- corollary discharge circuits - provide predictive motor signals from motor pathways to sensory processing 

- 2 pairs of ascending histaminergic neurons that function as CDC in other insects
- both AHNs receive input from partially overlapping populations of descending neurons
	- lots of input fro DNg02 - controls wing motor output
- AHN activation is correlated to flight behavior and precedes wing motion
- opto activation of DNg02 is sufficient to activate AHNs
- AHNs target sensory processing networks and networks for sensorimotor control
- AHNs provide predictive motor signal about wing motor state


- to distinguish reafference from exafference, the brain uses feedforward circuits called corollary discharge circuits
	- these provide predictive motor info to sensory and motor pathways
- CDCs are essential for animal to effectively use sensory information to make adaptive choices that optimize behavioral performance

- there are a small number of histaminergic neurons that project through central brain
	- drosophila have 2 pairs of histamine neurons that are ascending to the brain. the others are in the abdominal ganglion and do not ascend
- [[diphtheria toxin]] used to test driver lines and histamine expression

- located driver lines using [[FAFB]], [[FANC]], and [[MANC]] 
	- in the brain used arborization patterns and morphology to identify the neurons
	- in the vnc, used soma location and morphology to identify the neurons
	- used [[NBLAST]] to identify neuron similarity

- confirmed with DenMark imaging that they found the AHNs in connectomes and driver lines
- AHNs receive a lot of input from descending neurons in the connectome
	- DNg02 provides large proportion of input to AHNs
- [[DNg02]] 

[[ascending neurons tune sensorimotor behaviors]]

- AHNs are active with induction of flight, in part to excitatory input from DNg02
	- and this activity precedes wing movement
	- activation of these neurons do not induce flight
- majority of input to AHNs are inhibitory neurons
- one of the AHNs has only Johnston organ neurons as its sensory output.

- AHNs participate in a wing feedforward network with DNg02
	- each AHN pair targets different sensorimotor processes
	- the feedforward network likely modulates flight power output

- each AHN pair receives similar input about the wing state and then sends this information broadly to the rest of the VNC
