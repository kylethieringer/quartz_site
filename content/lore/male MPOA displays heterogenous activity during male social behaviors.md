the medial preoptic area (MPOA) can be divided into rostral and caudal sections with activity correlated to various stages of social interactions. the rostral section responds more to female interactions, including introduction, investigation, and mounting. the caudal section responds to the introduction of another animal (male or female), but then only shows increased activity during attack behaviors towards another male.
