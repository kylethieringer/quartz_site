- largest mechanosensory organ in Drosophila

- responds to hearing, touch, vestibular sensing, proprioception, and wind

- projects to the [[antennal mechanosensory and motor center|AMMC]]

- dendrites are stretched and compressed as the distal antennal segment rotates
- this movement activates JONs and the changes in firing activity are conveyed to the brain
- synapse onto the AMMC
